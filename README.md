# pokemon-list
Console app that fetches a list of Pokémon from Bulbapedia with a specified generation range.

Put this together quickly to play "who's that Pokémon" on skribbl.io with my friends.
Got a little carried away making small improvements, since I thought somewhere, someone
would find use in something like this. :)
